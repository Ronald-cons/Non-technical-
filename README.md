Thank you, Mr./Madame Deputy Speaker, Honorable and Right honorable members of the house, distinguished strangers in the gallery:

Laws should exist to defend the rights of people. We libertarians believe that individual liberty and private property are sacred and inviolable. About this Right, the American Declaration of Independence has a well-known phrase, "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness", which should be at the forefront of universal value. Yet we have seen, today, that Government power is constantly expanding, and the law is no longer being used to protect the rights of individuals, but rather to erode them. The law now doesn’t allow the truth, which has so much worth to society and individuals, to be at forefront of society. Any limitation on the truth is wrong. It is wrong that people cannot now make full decisions on actions due to a reeducation of truth. It is wrong that people cannot write the truth. It is wrong that people are limited to the extent they can pursue truth. We, therefore, propose to abolish the crime of defamation. Reputation is not a right. If you believe something to be true, why not let others test your belief? Why not let others opine?

Under libel and slander laws, people are punished because of their speech, but the mainstream media seems rarely be punished because of their points. If we need to censure and prosecute against disinformation, why are some “three-letter abbreviation media” still not sanctioned? The crime of defamation could be a tool of speech control. 

It is also used to create a fear of the future. The SNA claims to fake an alien invasion, the invasion is not definite, but this plan which would spend billions if not trillions of the taxpayers’ pounds is. My right honorable SNA friends aren’t underestimating the threats we face but rather the self-reliant and resilient people of this island. Napoleon called Britain a nation of shopkeepers, my SNA friends seem to agree with him. Bonaparte meant it as an insult, but to me, it's a compliment. That's why he could not beat this country.That’s why Hitler could not beat this country. 

The mechanisms of SNA’s clause is harming society by destroying property just to prove an alien invasion happened. This wastefulness proves that the state doesn’t know what is best for its citizens. Furthermore, they are actively causing distress to the people of their state. They didn’t make people happier by telling them that they had been saved from the unknown alien threat. Instead, the SNA made the people fear a potential alien counter attack. Never before has there been a mass fear of an alien. Until the SNA created one.

That’s why I’m proud to sit on the benches of the Distributists.

Thank you.
